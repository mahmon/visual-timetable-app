# Visual Timetable Android App

**A visual timetable mobile application designed to help ASD children with transitions at school**

This Android app was developed as part of my dissertation and final project for a BSc in Computing and Internet Technologies. The project aim was to develop a digital ‘visual timetable’ application, embracing the distinctive features offered by mobile apps, to alleviate transition anxieties experienced by ASD children.

The app was written in Java / XML using Android Studio.

### Key features
- Allows users to create a list of events, with a visual prompt
- Events feature a title, description, date and image
- App uses a CRUD system (create, read, update, delete) to store and manage events
- Events are stored in the cloud using [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) realtime database
- App also features a theme switcher to allow users to change the colour scheme

### Research into SEND education
In addition to this basic app, the project presented a significant amount of research and analysis into the problems that can arise when integrating children with special educational needs into mainstream school settings, with a particular focus on the challenges faced by children with profound sensory needs and complex communication issues.

My dissertation received a mark of 75% leading to the award of a first class BSc with honours.
