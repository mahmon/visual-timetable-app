# VisualTimetable

**A visual timetable application designed to help ASD children with transitions at school**


This Android app was developed as part of my dissertation and final project for a BSc in Computing and Internet Technologies. The project aim was to develop a digital ‘visual timetable’ application, embracing the distinctive features offered by mobile apps, to alleviate transition anxieties experienced by ASD children.

### Key features
- Allows users to create a list of events, with a visual prompt
- Events feature a title, description, date and image
- App users a CRUD system (create, read, update, delete) to manage events
- Events are stored in the cloud using google's Firebase realtime database
- App also features a theme switcher to allow users to change the colour scheme

In addition to this basic app, the project also involved a significant amount of research and analysis into the problems that can arise when integrating children with special educational needs into mainstream school settings, with a particular focus on the challenges faced by children with profound sensory needs and complex communication issues.

My dissertation received a mark of 75% and my final result for the whole degree was a first class BSc with honours.
